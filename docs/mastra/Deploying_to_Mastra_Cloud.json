    "text": "\n This page describes the deployment process for Mastra applications to Mastra Cloud using GitHub integration. \n Prerequisites \n \n A GitHub account \n A GitHub repository containing a Mastra application \n Access to Mastra Cloud \n \n Deployment Process \n Mastra Cloud uses a Git-based deployment workflow similar to platforms like Vercel and Netlify: \n \n \n Import GitHub Repository \n \n From the Projects dashboard, click “Add new” \n Select the repository containing your Mastra application \n Click “Import” next to the desired repository \n \n \n \n Configure Deployment Settings \n \n Set the project name (defaults to repository name) \n Select branch to deploy (typically main) \n Configure the Mastra directory path (defaults to src/mastra) \n Add necessary environment variables (like API keys) \n \n \n \n Deploy from Git \n \n After initial configuration, deployments are triggered by pushes to the selected branch \n Mastra Cloud automatically builds and deploys your application \n Each deployment creates an atomic snapshot of your agents and workflows \n \n \n \n Automatic Deployments \n Mastra Cloud follows a Git-driven workflow: \n \n Make changes to your Mastra application locally \n Commit changes to the main branch \n Push to GitHub \n Mastra Cloud automatically detects the push and creates a new deployment \n Once the build completes, your application is live \n \n Deployment Domains \n Each project receives two URLs: \n \n \n Project-specific domain: https://[project-name].mastra.cloud \n \n Example: https://gray-acoustic-helicopter.mastra.cloud \n \n \n \n Deployment-specific domain: https://[deployment-id].mastra.cloud \n \n Example: https://young-loud-caravan-6156280f-ad56-4ec8-9701-6bb5271fd73d.mastra.cloud \n \n \n \n These URLs provide direct access to your deployed agents and workflows. \n Viewing Deployments \n \n The deployments section in the dashboard shows: \n \n Title: Deployment identifier (based on commit hash) \n Status: Current state (success or archived) \n Branch: The branch used (typically main) \n Commit: The Git commit hash \n Updated At: Timestamp of the deployment \n \n Each deployment represents an atomic snapshot of your Mastra application at a specific point in time. \n Interacting with Agents \n \n After deployment, interact with your agents: \n \n Navigate to your project in the dashboard \n Go to the Agents section \n Select an agent to view its details and interface \n Use the Chat tab to communicate with your agent \n View the agent’s configuration in the right panel:\n \n Model information (e.g., OpenAI) \n Available tools (e.g., getWeather) \n Complete system prompt \n \n \n Use suggested prompts (like “What capabilities do you have?”) or enter custom messages \n \n The interface shows the agent’s branch (typically “main”) and indicates whether conversation memory is enabled. \n Monitoring Logs \n The Logs section provides detailed information about your application: \n \n Time: When the log entry was created \n Level: Log level (info, debug) \n Hostname: Server identification \n Message: Detailed log information, including:\n \n API initialization \n Storage connections \n Agent and workflow activity \n \n \n \n These logs help debug and monitor your application’s behavior in the production environment. \n Workflows \n \n The Workflows section allows you to view and interact with your deployed workflows: \n \n View all workflows in your project \n Examine workflow structure and steps \n Access execution history and performance data \n \n Database Usage \n Mastra Cloud tracks database utilization metrics: \n \n Number of reads \n Number of writes \n Storage used (MB) \n \n These metrics appear in the project overview, helping you monitor resource consumption. \n Deployment Configuration \n Configure your deployment through the dashboard: \n \n Navigate to your project settings \n Set environment variables (like OPENAI_API_KEY) \n Configure project-specific settings \n \n Changes to configuration require a new deployment to take effect. \n Next Steps \n After deployment, trace and monitor execution using the observability tools.
