    "text": "Setting Up a Mastra Cloud Project \n This page describes the steps to set up a project on Mastra Cloud using GitHub integration. \n Prerequisites \n \n A Mastra Cloud account \n A GitHub account \n A GitHub repository containing a Mastra application \n \n Project Creation Process \n \n \n Sign in to Mastra Cloud \n \n Navigate to the Mastra Cloud dashboard at https://cloud.mastra.ai  \n Sign in with your account credentials \n \n \n \n Add a New Project \n \n From the “All Projects” view, click the “Add new” button in the top right \n This opens the GitHub repository import dialog \n \n \n \n \n Import Git Repository \n \n Search for repositories or select from the list of available GitHub repositories \n Click the “Import” button next to the repository you want to deploy \n \n \n \n Configure Deployment Details \nThe deployment configuration page includes: \n \n Repo Name: The GitHub repository name (read-only) \n Project Name: Customize the project name (defaults to repo name) \n Branch: Select the branch to deploy (dropdown, defaults to main) \n Project root: Set the root directory of your project (defaults to /) \n Mastra Directory: Specify where Mastra files are located (defaults to src/mastra) \n Build Command: Optional command to run during build process \n Store Settings: Configure data storage options \n Environment Variables: Add key-value pairs for configuration (e.g., API keys) \n \n \n \n Project Structure Requirements \n Mastra Cloud scans the GitHub repository for: \n \n Agents: Agent definitions (e.g., Weather Agent) with models and tools \n Workflows: Workflow step definitions (e.g., weather-workflow) \n Environment Variables: Required API keys and configuration variables \n \n The repository should contain a standard Mastra project structure for proper detection and deployment. \n Understanding the Dashboard \n After creating a project, the dashboard shows: \n Project Overview \n \n Created Date: When the project was created \n Domains: URLs for accessing your deployed application\n \n Format: https://[project-name].mastra.cloud \n Format: https://[random-id].mastra.cloud \n \n \n Status: Current deployment status (success or archived) \n Branch: The branch deployed (typically main) \n Environment Variables: Configured API keys and settings \n Workflows: List of detected workflows with step counts \n Agents: List of detected agents with models and tools \n Database Usage: Reads, writes, and storage statistics \n \n Deployments Section \n \n List of all deployments with:\n \n Deployment ID (based on commit hash) \n Status (success/archived) \n Branch \n Commit hash \n Timestamp \n \n \n \n Logs Section \n The Logs view displays: \n \n Timestamp for each log entry \n Log level (info, debug) \n Hostname \n Detailed log messages, including:\n \n API startup information \n Storage initialization \n Agent and workflow activity \n \n \n \n Navigation \n The sidebar provides access to: \n \n Overview: Project summary and statistics \n Deployments: Deployment history and details \n Logs: Application logs for debugging \n Agents: List and configuration of all agents \n Workflows: List and structure of all workflows \n Settings: Project configuration options \n \n Environment Variable Configuration \n Set environment variables through the dashboard: \n \n Navigate to your project in the dashboard \n Go to the “Environment Variables” section \n Add or edit variables (such as OPENAI_API_KEY) \n Save the configuration \n \n Environment variables are encrypted and made available to your application during deployment and execution. \n Testing Your Deployment \n After deployment, you can test your agents and workflows using: \n \n The custom domain assigned to your project: https://[project-name].mastra.cloud \n The dashboard interface for direct interaction with agents \n \n Next Steps \n After setting up your project, automatic deployments occur whenever you push to the main branch of your GitHub repository. See the deployment documentation for more details. Overview Deploying",
